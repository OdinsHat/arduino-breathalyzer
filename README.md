# arduino-breathalyzer
A simple arduino breathalyser that uses the popular MQ3 digital and analog outputs. 
Runs on 3.3V and 5V though a 5v supply is preffered for the heating elements of these sensors.

As can be ascertained from the datasheet of the MQ3 the breathalyzer project here is fairly simplified not taking 
into account temperature changes. So I wouldn't recommend for people in the tropics or Canadian mountains due to the change on resistance 
and sensitivity of the element.
